## Description

When creating a social network web application, a backend API to store all of the data is necessary. This code is an API using the popular MongoDB due to its speed and flexibility at handling large amounts of data. Express.js handles the routes, MongoDB the database, and Mongoose for Object Data Modeling. It allows users to share their thoughts to the people of the platform, react to friend's thoughts and even add people to their own friend's list.
